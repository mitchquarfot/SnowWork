# S3 File Uploader - Isolated Snowflake Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the S3 File Uploader in a completely isolated environment for client access.

## üéØ **Deployment Goals**

- ‚úÖ Isolated infrastructure (warehouse, database, schema)
- ‚úÖ Dedicated client role with minimal permissions
- ‚úÖ Cost control and monitoring
- ‚úÖ No access to other Snowflake objects
- ‚úÖ Easy client user management

## üìã **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

- [ ] You have ACCOUNTADMIN role access
- [ ] Your working Streamlit app files are ready
- [ ] You have your AWS credentials configured in the app
- [ ] You've tested the app locally (confirmed uploads work)

## üöÄ **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Create Isolated Infrastructure**

Run the entire `snowflake_deployment_isolated.sql` script in Snowflake:

```sql
-- Run this file in Snowflake SQL Worksheet
-- File: snowflake_deployment_isolated.sql
```

This creates:
- **Warehouse**: `S3_UPLOADER_WH` (XSMALL, auto-suspend)
- **Database**: `S3_UPLOADER_DB`
- **Schema**: `CLIENT_ACCESS`
- **Stage**: `S3_UPLOADER_STAGE`
- **Role**: `S3_UPLOADER_CLIENT_ROLE`
- **Resource Monitor**: `S3_UPLOADER_MONITOR` (10 credits/month)

### **Step 2: Upload Streamlit Files**

After running the infrastructure script, upload your app files:

```sql
-- Upload the working Streamlit app
PUT file:///Users/mquarfot/Desktop/SnowWork/s3_uploader/streamlit_app.py @S3_UPLOADER_DB.CLIENT_ACCESS.S3_UPLOADER_STAGE AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE OVERWRITE=TRUE;

PUT file:///Users/mquarfot/Desktop/SnowWork/s3_uploader/requirements.txt @S3_UPLOADER_DB.CLIENT_ACCESS.S3_UPLOADER_STAGE AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE OVERWRITE=TRUE;

-- Verify upload
LIST @S3_UPLOADER_DB.CLIENT_ACCESS.S3_UPLOADER_STAGE;
```

### **Step 3: Get Streamlit App URL**

```sql
-- Get the app URL for clients
SHOW STREAMLITS LIKE 'S3_FILE_UPLOADER_APP' IN SCHEMA S3_UPLOADER_DB.CLIENT_ACCESS;
```

**Note the URL** - this is what you'll share with clients.

### **Step 4: Create Client Users**

Edit and run `client_user_management.sql`:

1. **Customize the user templates** with real client information
2. **Set secure passwords** (users must change on first login)
3. **Add client email addresses** for notifications
4. **Set expiration dates** if needed

Example:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE USER ACME_CORP_USER
    PASSWORD = 'TempSecure123!'
    DEFAULT_ROLE = 'S3_UPLOADER_CLIENT_ROLE'
    DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = 'S3_UPLOADER_WH'
    DEFAULT_NAMESPACE = 'S3_UPLOADER_DB.CLIENT_ACCESS'
    MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = TRUE
    EMAIL = 'uploads@acmecorp.com'
    DISPLAY_NAME = 'ACME Corp - File Upload User'
    COMMENT = 'File upload access for ACME Corporation';

GRANT ROLE S3_UPLOADER_CLIENT_ROLE TO USER ACME_CORP_USER;
```

### **Step 5: Test Client Access**

1. **Login as client user** to Snowflake
2. **Navigate to the Streamlit app URL**
3. **Test file upload functionality**
4. **Verify files appear in your S3 bucket**

## üîê **Security Features**

### **Isolation**
- Clients can ONLY access the S3 uploader app
- No visibility into other databases, warehouses, or objects
- Dedicated role with minimal permissions

### **Cost Control**
- Small warehouse (XSMALL) with auto-suspend
- Resource monitor with 10 credit monthly limit
- Automatic suspension at 100% quota

### **Access Control**
- Time-limited user accounts (optional)
- Password change required on first login
- Network policies (optional - configure in script)

### **Monitoring**
- User activity tracking
- Warehouse usage monitoring  
- Login attempt logging
- Cost tracking

## üìä **Client Information to Share**

Provide clients with:

```
Snowflake Account: [YOUR_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER]
Username: [CLIENT_USERNAME]
Password: [TEMPORARY_PASSWORD]
App URL: [STREAMLIT_APP_URL]

Instructions:
1. Login to Snowflake with provided credentials
2. Change password when prompted
3. Navigate to the app URL
4. Upload files as needed
```

## üîß **Management Commands**

### **Monitor Usage**
```sql
-- Check recent client activity
SELECT USER_NAME, START_TIME, QUERY_TEXT 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY 
WHERE ROLE_NAME = 'S3_UPLOADER_CLIENT_ROLE'
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC;

-- Check warehouse costs
SELECT WAREHOUSE_NAME, CREDITS_USED, START_TIME
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY 
WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'S3_UPLOADER_WH'
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC;
```

### **User Management**
```sql
-- Disable user
ALTER USER CLIENT_USER SET DISABLED = TRUE;

-- Reset password
ALTER USER CLIENT_USER SET PASSWORD = 'NewTemp123!' MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = TRUE;

-- Extend access
ALTER USER CLIENT_USER SET DAYS_TO_EXPIRY = 180;
```

### **Emergency Shutdown**
```sql
-- Suspend warehouse (stops all client access)
ALTER WAREHOUSE S3_UPLOADER_WH SUSPEND;

-- Disable all client users
-- (Use client_user_management.sql for bulk operations)
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure Summary**

| Object | Name | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Warehouse | `S3_UPLOADER_WH` | Compute for Streamlit app |
| Database | `S3_UPLOADER_DB` | Container for app objects |
| Schema | `CLIENT_ACCESS` | Namespace for client access |
| Stage | `S3_UPLOADER_STAGE` | Streamlit app files |
| Role | `S3_UPLOADER_CLIENT_ROLE` | Client permissions |
| App | `S3_FILE_UPLOADER_APP` | The Streamlit application |
| Monitor | `S3_UPLOADER_MONITOR` | Cost control |

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### **App Won't Load**
- Check warehouse is not suspended
- Verify user has correct role
- Confirm app URL is correct

### **Upload Fails**
- Check AWS credentials in app
- Verify S3 bucket permissions
- Test with smaller file

### **Access Denied**
- Confirm user has `S3_UPLOADER_CLIENT_ROLE`
- Check role grants
- Verify user is not disabled

### **High Costs**
- Check resource monitor settings
- Review warehouse size (XSMALL recommended)
- Monitor concurrent usage

## üéâ **Success Criteria**

‚úÖ Client can login with provided credentials  
‚úÖ Client can access Streamlit app URL  
‚úÖ Client can upload files successfully  
‚úÖ Files appear in your S3 bucket  
‚úÖ Client cannot access other Snowflake objects  
‚úÖ Costs remain within expected limits  

Your S3 File Uploader is now ready for client use! üöÄ
